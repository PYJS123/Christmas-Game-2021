# The basic idea:
* It is (or will become) a multiplayer game
* It might/will use the p5.js library for ease
* For the first requirement, it will use [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [socket.io](https://socket.io/)
* It will involve multiple Santas-on-sleds, racing each other to a finish line
* There will be objects in the way to increase/decrease speed, lives or points- e.g. wayward deer or a gift-wrapped present
* Players can avoid bad objects by moving out of the way, but if 2 sleds crash into each other, both players lose- they can spectate after
* (Eventually) There will be leaderboards and the ability to challenge others to and organise games
